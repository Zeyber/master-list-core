# Master List

An organizational list that leverages third-party APIs and displays information in a simple list.

Sometimes managing so many tasks can become overwhelming (eg. emails, agenda, tasks, social media, communications across multiple platforms). It is easy lose track of what needs to be done, when and how much you really need to do.

Master List is a node-based solution that runs on any machine within the command line. It features connecting to APIs via “providers” that can be configured to read relevant important information that the client may require.
